# Copilot Agents Registry

The open-source source of truth for GitHub Copilot agents and multi-agent flows.

## Project Scope

This repository defines deterministic, AI-readable specifications
and stores registry packages.

Registry responsibilities:

- Store agent and flow packages under `packages/`.
- Store package metadata and manifests.
- Store versioned deployment ZIPs and source archives for releases.
- Maintain AI-readable specifications in `specs/`.
- Provide examples and placeholder validation/build scripts.

This repository is intentionally data-first and specification-first.
Runtime logic is out of scope for this initial baseline.

## Package Baseline

Package format:

```text
<package-id>/
    metadata.json
    agents/
        <agent-id>.agent.md
        <agent-id>.metadata.json
    flows/
        <flow-id>.agent.md
        <flow-id>.metadata.json
    versions/
        manifest.json
        <version>/
            metadata.json
            agents/
                <agent-id>.agent.md
                <agent-id>.metadata.json
            flows/
                <flow-id>.agent.md
                <flow-id>.metadata.json
            <version>.zip
            <version>-src.zip
```

Package rules:

- A package must have at least one agent or flow.
- `agents/` or `flows/` may be absent if unused.
- `versions/manifest.json` tracks all releases.
- Each published release lives in `versions/<version>/`.
- `versions/<version>/metadata.json` preserves the historical package metadata
    for that release.
- `versions/<version>/agents/` and `versions/<version>/flows/` preserve the
    historical source tree for that release.
- Each release includes `<version>.zip` and `<version>-src.zip`.
- Use semantic versioning with no `v` prefix.
- Use SHA-256 checksums.
- The package root `metadata.json`, `agents/`, and `flows/` describe the
    current working state.
- ZIP bundles merge all `agents/*.agent.md` and `flows/*.agent.md`
  into a single `agents/` folder for extraction into `.github/`.

## Specifications

All normative specifications are stored in `specs/`
and written to be deterministic for AI and tool consumption.

Primary spec documents:

- `specs/package-format.md`
- `specs/metadata-schema.md`
- `specs/manifest-schema.md`
- `specs/agent-format.md`
- `specs/flow-format.md`
- `specs/versioning-rules.md`

## Related Repositories
